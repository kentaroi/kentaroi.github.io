# twlikes app Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on twlikes for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.


## Twitter
twlikes was a kind of Twitter client and it needed to make many requests to Twitter's service. Please read Twitter's privacy policy for more details on what they may do with that data.

With the removal of Twitter API 1.1, twlikes was discontinued, and now it only accesses Twitter API for authentication.


## Information we collect
We used to collect information via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/ "Firebase"), but now we no longer collect any information because of the termination of the service.


## Contact us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices. Please tweet or send message us at [@twlikes_app](https://twitter.com/twlikes_app "twlikes app").
