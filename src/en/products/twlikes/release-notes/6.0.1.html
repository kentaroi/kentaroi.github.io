Fixed a crash bug when displaying images on iOS 17

6.0.0:
With the discontinuation of Twitter API 1.1, I cannot continue to provide the service of the twlikes app.
The update is not for new users, but for existing users who've been using the app, and aims to allow users to continue to view the tweets that they liked which have been fetched.
