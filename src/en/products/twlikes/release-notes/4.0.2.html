gratitude: |
  Thank you all very much for registering a paid subscription.
  More bug fixes are coming in a week.
  If your accounts diappeared from accounts view, could you please add your accounts again in accounts view?
  Please make sure to backup(export) your data before upgrading to a new iPhone, otherwise you will lose all of your likes and its tags.

Fixed following bugs:
- Crash when importing data when no accounts in twlikes
- Crash when saving photos

When older Twitter app is installed on your iPhone, adding Twitter account to twlikes might fail.
To avoid it, added a web based way of account connection.
- Please long-press "+" button in Accounts view, you will see a web based login option.
