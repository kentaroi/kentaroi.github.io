    <h1>5.3.1</h1>
    
    Changed in 5.3.1:
- Fixed bugs that were causing the app to crash such as when no swipe actions were configured in left or right
- Fixed a bug that failed to add a tag which was once removed in "Add tags" screen
- Fixed a bug that duplicated a tag in MOST RECENT TAGS in "Add tags" screen when removing it, which had been tagged to part of the tweets
- Improved UI

Changed in 5.3.0:
- Swipe actions became configurable.
- Tweets became selectable, and you can tag multiple tweets at once.
