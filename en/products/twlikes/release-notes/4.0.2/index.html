    <h1>4.0.2</h1>
    
    Fixed following bugs:
- Crash when importing data when no accounts in twlikes
- Crash when saving photos

When older Twitter app is installed on your iPhone, adding Twitter account to twlikes might fail.
To avoid it, added a web based way of account connection.
- Please long-press "+" button in Accounts view, you will see a web based login option.
